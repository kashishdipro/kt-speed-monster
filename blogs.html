                <h3><strong>Question 1:</strong> What are the difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>
                <p><strong>Ans:</strong> Local storage is store data in browser without any expiration date. Data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Data is available for future sessions. The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB.</p>
                <p>Session storage is store data in browser for a session. Data is deleted when the browser is closed. Data is not available for future sessions. The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.</p>

                <h3><strong>Question 2:</strong> What are the difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
                <p><strong>Ans:</strong> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.</p>
                <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>
